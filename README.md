# Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) & Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) Simulation
Attempt at simulating the single photon experiment from my Quantum Information Lab, including results for:
1. Second order correlation coefficient $(g^2 (0))$
2. Power dependence based on polarisation angle of half-wave plate

## Current files: 
- Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (2 detector) simulation

## To be added:
- SPDC & HBT simulations combined: 3-detector coincidence count setup, with added noise models (e.g. dark spots, jitter)
- Power dependence simulation
- Schematics for g^2(0) and power dependence measurements (add half-wave plate to vary angle/power)
